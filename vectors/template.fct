# First, every line starting with a '#' will be treated as a comment line
# Blank lines will also be skipped.

# Those two following lines are just helpers to make it easier to configure the right pin.

# The 'config' key describes how the tested board has it connections. 
# 
# 'p' - power pin, do nothing
# 'i' - input pin on tested board
# 'o' - output pin on tested board
# 'O' - output pin on tested board, open collector
# 'd' - pull down net on tested board
# 'g' - pin should be grounded on tested board
# '-' - pin should not be used, don't care and it will be electrically disconnected

# There can be multiple 'vector' keys. They are processed in order from top to bottom in the file. 
# If pin is configured to input, '01T' are valid configurations. 'T' toggles one pin only (one T per row) 
# and it's purpose is for debugging and half manual tests. 
# If the pin is configured as output, the pin value will be checked against
# the given value (only '0' and '1' is valid) after all inputs has been set.
