TODO: list of things to implement/fix
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
[ ] Test output drive strength
[ ] Allow individual configuration of electrical properties of PIN's
[ ] Single step testing
[ ] HALT or PAUSE when a failure occurs as option
[ ] Add the possibility to output a pulse from a single line in logic test
[ ] Use the tester as DMM (measurements in a loop)
[ ] Add design files for electronics (KiCad)
[x] Test input current
[x] Loop testing
[x] Free test vectors
[x] What and where should result be printed
[x] udev rule to initiate board and export GPIO's
[x] Validate test vectors more (validate characters)
[x] Move out test functions to own file
[x] Let Makefile install everything?
[x] Parse command line arguments first, then execute
[x] udev does not run the script. Absolute path?
[x] Break on failures
[x] Load and verify vectors in own file
[x] Clean up hal.c (return when error, handle errors)
[x] Use the modern /dev/ GPIO interface for GPIO's
